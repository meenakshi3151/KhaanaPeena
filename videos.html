                   <br>
                   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                   <p><h2>For Paneer Tikka:</h2></p>

                   <p>250g paneer, cubed
                    1/2 cup thick yogurt
                    1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
                    1 tablespoon red chili powder
                    1/2 tablespoon turmeric powder
                    1 tablespoon garam masala
                    1 tablespoon lemon juice
                    Salt to taste
                    Skewers (wooden or metal)
                    <h2>  For Gravy:</h2></p>
                  
                    <p>
                    2 tablespoons oil or ghee
                    1 large onion, finely chopped
                    2 large tomatoes, pureed
                    1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
                    1 teaspoon cumin powder
                    1 teaspoon coriander powder
                    1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
                    1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
                    1 teaspoon garam masala
                    1/2 cup heavy cream
                    Salt to taste
                    Chopped cilantro for garnishing</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li> Caution-1:Use fresh and good-quality paneer for the best results. Firm paneer holds its shape better during marination and grilling.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> Caution-2:Grill or bake the paneer until it develops a slightly charred exterior. Make sure not to overcook it, as overcooking can make the paneer tough and rubbery.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> Caution-3: Adjust the amount of red chili powder and spices according to your preference for heat. Always start with a smaller amount and add more as needed.</li>

                <p>Hyderabadi Biryani is a classic and iconic Indian dish that originated in the city of Hyderabad, India. It's a fragrant and flavorful rice dish that combines marinated meat (usually chicken, mutton, or goat) with aromatic basmati rice,
                 cooked together with spices and herbs. The dish is known for its distinctive blend of flavors and the use of long-grain rice that's cooked "dum" style, which means it's slow-cooked in a sealed pot to trap the steam and aromas.</p>
<br>
                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <p><h2>For Hyderabadi Biryani:</h2></p>
<p>1 kg chicken, cut into pieces
    1 cup yogurt
    1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
    1 teaspoon red chili powder
    1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
    Salt to taste
    2 cups basmati rice, washed and soaked for 30 minutes
Whole spices (bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cloves, cardamom pods)
Fried onions (crispy and golden)
Saffron strands soaked in warm milk
Chopped mint and cilantro leaves
Ghee (clarified butter) or oil
Fried cashews and raisins (optional)
</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li> Caution1:Marinate the meat (if using) for an adequate amount of time. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat and make it tender. </li>
                     <br>
                     <li> Caution2:Parboil the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked. The rice should still have a slight bite to it. Overcooking the rice at this stage can lead to mushy biryani.</li>
                     <br>
                     <li>  Caution3:When fluffing the biryani after cooking, use a fork or a gentle hand to prevent breaking the rice grains. Mix the layers gently to distribute flavors.</li>

            <p>Dal Baati is a traditional Rajasthani dish from India that consists of two main components: "dal," which is a lentil curry, and "baati," which are round, flaky wheat flour dumplings. It's a hearty and flavorful dish that's often enjoyed as a main course in Rajasthani cuisine.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p><h2>For Dal:</h2></p>

            <p>1 cup yellow split lentils (toor dal)
                1 small onion, finely chopped
                1 small tomato, chopped
                1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
                1 teaspoon cumin seeds
                1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
                1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
                1/2 teaspoon garam masala
                Salt to taste
                Water
                Oil or ghee for tempering

                <h2>
                    Baati
                </h2>
            <p>
                    2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup semolina (sooji)
1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter)
Salt to taste
Water
                </p>
            <ul>
                 <li>Caution1: Use good-quality ghee or oil for tempering and cooking. Quality fats enhance the flavors of the dish.</li>
                 <br>
                 <li> Caution2:Garnish the dal with chopped cilantro just before serving to preserve its freshness and vibrant color.</li>
                 <br>
                 <li>Caution3:Like any traditional dish, making Dal Baati might require practice to get the proportions and cooking techniques right. Don't be discouraged by initial results; it's a skill that improves over time.</li>
